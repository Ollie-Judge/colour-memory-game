## Issues when making the project
* Connecting the background image to the project - (FIXED) the code was fine, only problem was that i needed to clear my cache, once i did a hard reset by clicking reload in the dev-tools window i found that everything loaded.

* The level will not advance past level 1 - (FIXED) the id selector was missing the hashtag which stopped it from working

* No instructions and therefore not easy to understand what to do - Added instructions to the page

* Doesnt work on phone as it requires a keyboard button to be pushed which cant be done on a phone or tablet

* Colours appear in their own seperate columns which doesnt make it easy for the user to see or play the game
